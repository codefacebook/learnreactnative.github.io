React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app but you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

### React Native Features

* React − This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript.

* Native − You can use native components controlled by JavaScript.

* Platforms − React Native supports iOS and Android platform.

### React Native Features

* JavaScript − You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps.

* Code sharing − You can share most of your code on different platforms.

* Community − The community around React and React Native is large, and you will be able to find any answer you need.

### React Native Limitations

* Native Components − If you want to create native functionality which is not created yet, you will need to write some platform specific code.
